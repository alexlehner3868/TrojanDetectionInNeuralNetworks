Plan:

Step 1: (April 13th) 
  - Data splitting pipeline --> Alex
  - Model evaluation functions (metrics + graphs) --> Mahmoud
  - Build clean image classifier using CIFAR-10 dataset (e.g., ResNet-18 or CNN) --> Jas 
Step 2: (March 6th) 
  - Add poison class (maintaining same class distribution)
  - Get clean image classifer to classify poison class (Make sure misclassification rate between poison and not poison is 0)
Step 3: (April 1st) 
  - Trojan Detection (Everyone)
  - Quick experiments on ratio of poison class and size of trigger (1 person) 



Breifing: March 12
